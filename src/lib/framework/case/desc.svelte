				The World Customs Organization (WCO) is the international authority on customs and
				border security. The body oversees 98% of world trade and its role is to secure the
				international trade supply chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				It created the IPM system, a real-time communication hub that connects border force
				officers on the ground and private members. After 4 years its usage remained limited
				to a handful of border agencies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Research revealed that user interface issues were a major blocker to adoption. The
				WCO approached us to rethink the system. We adopted a user-centred approach to
				improve the usability. Following the release of the new system, usage grew to cover
				border agencies in 100+ countries and improved the results of ground operations
				manifold.
